<h1>The passage of time</h1>
<p>The last US presidential election was just over four years ago. I was buying a home.</p>

<p>Since then, my father died. I had one brief girlfriend and now have a long-term partner.</p>

<p>My partner is a traveller, and with her I have been to Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, Belfast, Budapest and Barcelona; the British Peak- and Lake Districts, to the Rutland Water Nature Reserve, to and around the Norfolk Coast AONB and the Norfolk Broads, to Oxford, to York, (and I have shown her the South Coast where I grew up, Portsmouth, Chichester, Arundel, Brighton, and the Queen Elizabeth Country Park); in Kenya to Nairobi and to Hells Gate National Park; in California to San Francisco, Asilomar, along Route 1, Sacramento, the Sequoia, Sierra and Yosemite national parks, to Fort Bragg's "Glass Beach", to Lakes Berryessa and Tahoe; and because of her but not with her I have been to Rotterdam, Berlin (again), Hannover, Frankfurt, Zürich, Heidelberg, Köln, and Luxembourg.</p>

<p>I lost a friend because of Brexit, and somehow then managed to become an international dog minder. I've looked after six fluff-faces in three countries over the last four and a half months.</p>

<p>The post-Brexit months have taken me from (Duolingo level) zero to 20 in Esperanto, seen me write a short story and add a few tens of thousands of words to my novel.</p>

<p>The election (and Brexit) gave me despair, but writing down all the things that have gone <em>well</em> has given me hope. Yes, I know I'm privileged. I sympathise, and in the cases of religious and sexual minorities I empathise, but I really don't know what to do to help those in need any more.</p>
