<h1>Not a Singularity but an Event Horizon</h1>
<p>I was never a fan of the term "Singularity" for the AI thing. When mathematical singularities pop up in physics, it's usually a sign the physics is missing something.</p>

<p>Instead, I like to think of the AI "event horizon", the point in the future — always ahead, yet getting ever closer — beyond which you can no longer predict what happens next.</p>

<p>Obviously that will depend on how much attention you pay to the developments in the field (and I've seen software developers surprised by Google Translate having an AR mode a decade after the tech was first demonstrated), but there is an upper limit even for people who obsessively consume all public information about a topic: if you're reading about it when you go to sleep, will you be surprised when you wake up by all the overnight developments?</p>
