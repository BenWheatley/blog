<div class="content"><h1>The Totally Credible Heroes</h1>
<p class="p3">Superheroes, but all their powers are incredibly minor:</p>

<ul class="ul1">
	<li class="li3"><b>Übermensch</b> has 5 milliwatt laser eyes, giving him the power to entertain cats and give PowerPoint presentations without the need of a laser pointer. He has occasionally dazzled himself while shaving.</li>
	<li class="li3"><b>Water-Woman</b> has webbed hands and feet, so can swim quite fast. She also has a habit of talking to seaweed, but it doesn’t reply.</li>
	<li class="li3"><b>The Sprinter</b> can run a half-marathon at the speed an average person can sprint 400 meters. He has been banned from most sporting events, even the ones he would lose.</li>
	<li class="li3"><b>Mr Boring</b> is so dull nobody pays him any attention, making him essentially invisible to anyone except security guards.</li>
	<li class="li3"><b>Cat Man</b> likes to dress up as a cat, but denies all suggestions that he is a furry. The claws are his own fingernails cut into points, and not particularly dangerous.</li>
	<li class="li3"><b>Cyber-Woman</b> has cochlear implants which can be connected to her phone via Bluetooth. She also has a prosthetic leg which looks pretty futuristic, but doesn’t do anything unusual.</li>
	<li class="li3"><b>Doctor Komisch</b> has a PhD in the politics of the British Isles in the 13th century, and is a practicing Wiccan priest. He is skilled at cold-reading, but none of the spells he knows do more than make him feel happy.</li>
	<li class="li3"><b>Titanium Man</b> likes to build his own jet packs and similar flying apparatus. His jet packs are very expensive to build and consume a lot of fuel.</li>
	<li class="li3"><b>The Greek</b> is a dominatrix with a kevlar rope lasso. She is a skilled interrogator, and can get the truth about 95% of the time.</li>
	<li class="li3"><b>Miss Tesla</b> can generate and sense weak magnetic fields from her nerves, allowing her to read and edit the magnetic stripe on any credit card she can touch, to open magnetically sealed doors, and to pick up small ferrous objects that would otherwise only be reachable with a magnet on a stick.</li>
	<li class="li3"><b>The Human Dragon</b> can belch methane. It only catches fire with an external source of ignition, and is much like a street entertainer performing fire-breathing only slightly less impressive.</li>
	<li><strong>The Face-shifter</strong> has unusually elastic skin and far more tiny face muscles than normal, and can perfectly mimic the face of anyone… provided they have similar melanin levels, no obvious moles, birthmarks, or current sunburn. They cannot transform their hair, but they have heard of wigs and hair dye.</li>
</ul>
