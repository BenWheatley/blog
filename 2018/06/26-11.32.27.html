<div class="content"><h1>Unlearnable</h1>
<p>How many things are there, which one cannot learn? No matter how much effort is spent trying?</p>

<p>I'm aware that things like conscious control of intestinal peristalsis would fit this question (probably… I mean, who would've tried?) but I'm not interested in purely autonomous stuff.</p>

<p>Assuming the stereotypes are correct, I mean stuff like adults not being able to fully cross the Chinese-English language barrier in either direction if they didn't learn both languages as children (if you read out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_Den" target="_blank">The Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den</a> I can tell that the <em>Shi</em>s are different to each other, but I can't tell if the difference I hear actually conveys a difference-of-meaning or if it is just natural variation of the sort I produce if I say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo" target="_blank">"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo"</a>, and I'm told this difficulty persists even with practice; in reverse, the 'R'/'L' error is a common stereotype of Chinese people speaking English). Is there something like that for visual recognition? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia" target="_blank">Some people cannot recognise faces</a>, is there something like that but for all humans? Something where no human can recognise which of two things they are looking at, even if we know that a difference exists?</p>

<p>Languages in general seem to be extremely difficult for most adults: personally, I've never been able to get my mind around all the tenses of irregular verbs in French… but is that <em>genuinely unlearnable</em> or something I could overcome with perseverance? I found German quite straightforward, so there may be something else going on.</p>

<p>Are there any other possibilities? Some people struggle with maths: is it <em>genuinely unlearnable</em> by the majority, or just <em>difficult and lacking motive</em>? Probability in particular comes to mind, because people can have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem" target="_blank">Monty Hall problem</a> explained and not get it.</p>

<p>One concept I've only just encountered, but which suddenly makes sense of a lot of behaviour I've seen in politics, is called <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Morton%27s_demon" target="_blank">Morton's demon</a> by analogy with Maxwell's demon. A filter at the level of perception which allows people to ignore and reject without consideration facts which ought to change their minds. It feels — and I recognise with amusement the oddity of using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems" target="_blank">system 1 thinking</a> at this point — like a more powerful thing than <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cherry_picking" target="_blank">Cherry picking</a>, <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance" target="_blank">Cognitive dissonance</a>, <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias" target="_blank">Confirmation bias</a>, etc., and it certainly represents — with regard to system 2 thinking — the sort of "unlearnable" I have in mind.</p>
