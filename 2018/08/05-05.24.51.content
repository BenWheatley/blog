<h1>Dynamic range of Bayesian thought</h1>
<p>We naturally use something close to Bayesian logic when we learn and intuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/R13BD8qKeTg?t=6m27s" target="_blank">Bayesian logic doesn't update when the prior is 0 or 1. Some people can't shift their opinions, no matter what evidence they have. This is compatible with them having priors of 0 or 1.</a></p>

<p>It would be implausible for humans to store neural weights with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number" target="_blank">‚Ñùeal numbers</a>. How many bits (base-2) do we use to store our implicit priors? My gut feeling says it's a shockingly small number, perhaps 4.</p>

<p>How little evidence do we need to become trapped in certainty? Is it even constant (or close to) for all humans?</p>
