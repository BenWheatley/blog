<h1>Brexit as an example of failure to comprehend conditional probabilities</h1>
<a href="https://kitsunesoftware.wordpress.com/2016/05/09/eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It's been 2 years 5 months 12 days 12 hours 25 minutes since my first post about Brexit</a>, and I still don't really know what will happen.

<p>Almost everything is conditional probability: "<em>If</em> there's a hard (no-deal) Brexit, <em>then</em> the traffic jams from Dover, Harwich/Felixstowe, etc. will be about as long as is physically possible given the number of trucks in the UK."</p>

<p>Conditional probabilities <em>suck</em> for human-human interactions.</p>

<p>Any pro-Brexit person who reads that will tend, I think, to remember that prediction without the "if" clause; and <em>if</em> there is a deal, they will be much more likely to crow about it as "yet another Remoaner failure". (Also often missed: "much more likely" doesn't mean "will", but I keep seeing people read it that way).</p>

<p>This sort of prediction tends to be used by propagandists as a modern-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cassandra</a>: the worst case scenario is so bad that everyone strives to prevent it — in this case by not countenancing a no-deal scenario — and so it becomes just another reason to distrust experts who fought against a no-deal scenario. In turn, this increases the chances of something as bad as a no-deal scenario next time. I see the same thing with the Millennium Bug, and as a kid with global warming (<a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/ice-age-predictions-in-1970s.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no, it wasn't scientists who told you we were heading straight into an ice age, it was newspapers; any scientists actually talking about an actual ice age were talking about the end of an interglacial warm period and were even then outnumbered 6-to-1 by those concerned about things getting warmer</a>).</p>

<p>I can only think of three post-Brexit-Great-Britain (yes I do mean GB, not UK, I know too little about NI) predictions that are <em>not</em> conditional on the final form that Brexit takes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The UK population will still be arguing about it</li>
	<li>These arguments will involve at least one large march (≥10,000 people)</li>
	<li>At least one building will be set on fire (or an attempt will be made: they're designed to not be on fire)</li>
</ol>
<p>I put at least 1-in-3 odds that events 2 and 3 will be performed by both angry Leavers and angry Remainers.</p>
