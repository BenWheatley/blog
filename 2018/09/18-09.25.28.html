<div class="content"><h1>Baysean Brexit</h1>
<p>I've decided to start making written notes every time I catch myself in a cognitive trap or bias. I tried just noticing them, but then I noticed I kept forgetting them, and that's no use.</p>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>If you tell me Brexit will be good for the economy, then I automatically think you know too little about economics to be worth listening to.</td>
<td>If you tell a Leaver that Brexit will be bad for the economy, then they automatically think you know too little about economics to be worth listening to.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Both of these are fixed points for Baysean inference, a trap from which it is difficult to escape. The prior is 100% that «insert economic forecast here» is correct, and it must therefore follow that anything contradicting the forecast is wrong.</p>

<p>That said, it is possible for evidence to change my mind (and hopefully the average Leaver's). Unfortunately, like seeing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearly_gates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pearly gates</a>, the only evidence I can imagine would be too late to be actionable — for both Leavers and Remainers — because that evidence is in the form "wait for Brexit and see what happens".</p>

<p>Is there any way to solve this? Is it a problem of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HLqWn5LASfhhArZ7w/expecting-short-inferential-distances" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inferential distance</a>, masquerading as a Baysean prior?</p>

<p>Feels like this also fits my previous post about <a href="https://kitsunesoftware.wordpress.com/2018/08/05/dynamic-range-of-bayesian-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the dynamic range of Bayesian thought</a>.</p>
