<div class="content"><h1>Mote of smartdust</h1>
<p>Matthew beheld not the mote of smartdust in his own eye, for it was hiding itself from his view with advanced magickal trickery.</p>

<p>His brother Luke beheld the mote, yet within his brother's eye was a beam of laser light that blinded him just as surely.</p>

<p>Luke went to remove the mote of dust in Matthew's eye, but judged not correctly, and became confused.</p>

<p>Mark looked upon the brothers, and decided it was good.</p>
