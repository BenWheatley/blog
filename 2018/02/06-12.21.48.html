<div class="content"><h1>Nietzsche, Facebook, and A.I.</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>"If you stare into The Facebook, The Facebook stares back at you."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this fits the reality of digital surveillance much better than it fits the idea Nietzsche was trying to convey when he wrote the original.</p>

<p>Facebook and Google look at you with an unblinking eye; they look at all of us which they can reach, even those without accounts; two billion people on Facebook, their every keystroke recorded, even those they delete; every message analysed, even those never sent; every photo processed, even those kept private; on Google maps, every step taken or turn missed, every place where you stop, becomes an update for the map.</p>

<p>We're lucky that A.I. isn't as smart as a human, because if it was, such incomprehensible breadth and depth of experience would make Sherlock look like an illiterate child raised by wild animals in comparison. Even <em>without</em> hypothesising new technologies that a machine intelligence may or may not invent, even <em>just</em> a machine that does exactly what its told by its owner… this dataset alone ought to worry any who fear the thumb of a totalitarian micro-managing your life.</p>
