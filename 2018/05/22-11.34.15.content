<h1>Hyperloop's secondary purposes</h1>
<p>I can't believe it took me this long (and until watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KerG4ILWEa4" target="_blank">this video my Isaac Arthur</a>) to realise that <strong>Hyperloop is a tech demo for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_loop" target="_blank">Launch loop</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I (along with many others) had realised the stated reason for the related–but–separate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boring_Company" target="_blank">The Boring Company</a> was silly. My first thought for that was it was a way to get a lot of people underground for a lot of the time, which would reduce the fatalities from a nuclear war. Other people had the much better observation that experience with tunnelling is absolutely vital for any space colony. (It may be notable that BFR is the same diameter as the SpaceX/TBC test tunnel, or it may just be coincidence).</p>

<p>A similar argument applies to Hyperloop as to TBC: <strong>Hyperloop is a better normal-circumstances transport system than cars and roads when colonising a new planet</strong>.</p>
