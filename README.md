## Motivation

I've wanted to make my existing blog available in github for ages now, but didn't have time until recently.

Blogging in github means I can skip all the annoying cruft by the usual blogging platforms that makes things generally *increasingly bad* over years in the service of [Resume-driven development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02850), and that I can completely skip all tracking cookies etc. just by not using them in the first place (yes, you too can *just not use them*) and by that one weird trick that marketers hate, I don't need to show that annoying GDPR popup.

I've written a bulk importer, which kinda worked but is a bit flakey, so I may still need to tidy up the old ones for style and for content lost in transition.
