<div class="content"><h1>Hypothesise first, test later</h1>
<p>Brought to you by me noticing that when I watch Kristen Bell playing an awful person in The Good Place, I feel as stressed as when I have to consciously translate to or from German in real-life situations and not just language apps.</p>

<h2>Idea:</h2>

<ul><li>System 2 thinking (effortful) is stressful to the mind in the same way that mild exercise is stressful to the body.</li>
<li>Having to think in system 2 continuously is sometimes possible, but how long for is not a universal constant.</li>
<li>Social interactions are smoothed by being able to imagine what other people are thinking.</li>
<li>If two minds think in different ways, one or both has to use system 2 thinking to forecast the other. Autistic and neurotypical minds are one of many possible examples in the human realm. Cats and dogs are a common non-human example (“Play! Bark!” “Arg, big scary predator! Hiss!”)</li>
<li>Stress makes personal touches and eye contact unpleasant.</li></ul>

<h2>Implications:</h2>

<p>Autistic people will be:</p>

<ul><li>Much less stressed when they are only around other autistic people.</li>
<li>Look each other in the eye.</li>
<li>Be comfortable hugging each other.</li>
<li>Less likely than allistic people to watch soap operas.</li>
<li>Jokes based on mind state will not transfer, but puns will. (The opposite of the German-English joke barrier, as puns don't translate but The Ministry Of Silly Walks does).</li>
<li>Reality shows will make no sense, and be somewhere between comedic and confusing in the same way as memes based on "type XYZ and let autocomplete finish the sentence!"</li></ul>

<h2>Questions:</h2>

<ul><li>How to interests, e.g. sports, music, painting, fit into this?</li>
<li>Does "gender" work like this? Memes such as "Men are from Mars, women are from Venus" or men finding women confusing and unpredictable come to mind. Also, men's clubs are a thing, as are women's. Also the existence of transgender people would pattern-match here. That said, it might just be a cultural barrier, because any group can have a culture and culture is not merely a synonym for political geography.</li></ul>
