<div class="content"><h1>Ohne Kaffee</h1>
<p>As anyone who has spent any significant time with me will know, I have a genuinely problematic relationship with coffee. If I don't watch myself I can drink nothing but coffee all day, sometimes even double strength — 4 cups is one thing, 2 litres of double strength is too much.</p>

<p>Because of this, every so often I try to cut it out entirely. This time, I'm trying to keep a diary.</p>
<h2>Day 1, Saturday</h2>
<p>A bit tired, nothing special.</p>
<h2>Day 2, Sunday</h2>
<p>Really tired, bad headache, took ibuprofen.</p>
<h2>Day 3, Monday</h2>
<p>A bit tired, occasionally tempted to grab a coffee from the machine at work.</p>
<h2>Day 4, Tuesday</h2>
<p>Working from home along with everyone else because of Coronavirus. A bit tired, very unfocused. Not sure if the loss of focus is from the switch to home office or from the withdrawal. Definitely feeling like a coffee would help.</p>

<p>Leg ache developed in the evening, feeling like I'd run 5 km.</p>
<h2>Day 5, Wednesday</h2>
<p>Arm and leg muscles ache.</p>
<h2>Day 6, Thursday</h2>
<p>No issues.</p>
