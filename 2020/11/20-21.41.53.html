<div class="content"><h1>Truthiness &amp; COVID denial by the dying</h1>
<p>Enough people believe enough odd things that I was not surprised when I learned of COVID deniers; not just because the same happened a century ago with Influenza, but also my own former (as a teenager, now embarrassing) sincere belief in the occult.</p>

<p>Indeed, even when it comes to people denying the existence of COVID even in their dying breath <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wired.com/story/are-covid-patients-gasping-it-isnt-real-as-they-die/" target="_blank">(and despite claims that these reports are, if not incorrect, then exaggerated)</a>, I find this scenario very plausible thanks to the unfortunate path of my father’s bowel cancer.</p>

<p>Bowel cancer, as you might guess, can require a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy" target="_blank">colectomy</a> and the subsequent use of a colostomy bag. As one function of the colon is to absorb water, skipping it means you <em>must</em> increase your consumption to compensate. My father did not drink more water, and therefore suffered kidney failure just as I arrived for that year’s family Christmas — so I got to listen to his nurse telling my father all of the things I’ve just written about in order to explain to him why he now had an emergency hydration drip going in one arm and an emergency kidney rescue drug going in the other. Despite this, my father absolutely denied there was anything was wrong with how much water he was drinking.</p>

<p>He died two months later.</p>
