<h1>The worst form of government except for all the others</h1>
<p>(Does this sound fair? I'm not formally qualified in politics).</p>
<h1>Democracy</h1>The only way to get a government which wants to do the sort of things the public are OK with.
<h2>Technocracy</h2>The only way to get a government of people who know what they're talking about.
<h2>Industrialism</h2>The only way to provide a government with the capability to do things.

<p>(Not "capitalism" in general, industry in particular).</p>
<h2>Diplomacy</h2>The only way to provide a government with awareness that other nations can have their own desires and goals which differ from it's own.
<h2>Journalism/Police</h2>The only way to fight corruption.
