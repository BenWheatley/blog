<div class="content"><h1>Morality, thy discount is hyperbolic</h1>
<p>One well known failure mode of Utilitarian ethics is a thing called a "utility monster" — for any value of "benefit" and "suffering", it's possible to postulate an entity (Bob) and a course of action (The Plan) where Bob receives so much benefit that <em>everyone</em> else can suffer arbitrarily great pain and yet you "should" still do The Plan.</p>

<p>That this can happen is often used as a reason to <em>not</em> be a Utilitarian. Never mind that there are no known real examples — when something is paraded as a logical universal ethical truth, it's not allowed to even have theoretical problems, for much the same reason that God doesn't need to actually "microwave a burrito so hot that even he can't eat it" for the mere possibility to be a proof that no god is capable of being all-powerful.</p>

<p>I have previously suggested a way to limit this — <a href="https://kitsunesoftware.wordpress.com/2018/01/21/normalised-n-dimensional-utility-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normalisation</a> — but that was obviously not good enough for a group. What I was looking for then was a way to combine multiple entities in a sensible fashion, and now I've found one already existed: hyperbolic discounting.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperbolic discounting</a> is how we all naturally think about the future: the further into the future a reward is, the less important we regard it. For example, if I ask "would you rather have $15 immediately; or $30 after three months; or $60 after one year; or $100 after three years?" most people find those options equally desirable, even though nobody's expecting the US dollar to lose 85% of its value in just three years.

<p>Most people do a similar thing with large numbers, although logarithmic rather than hyperbolic. There's a cliché with presenters describing how big some number X is by saying X-seconds is a certain number of years and acting like it's surprising that "while a billion seconds is 30 years, a trillion is 30 thousand years". (Personally I am so used to this truth that it feels weird that they even need to say it).</p>

<p>So, what's the point of this? Well, one of the ways the Utility Monster makes a certain category of nerd look like an arse is the long-term future of humanity. The sort of person who (mea culpa) worries about X-risks (eXtinction risks), and says "don't worry about climate change, worry about non-aligned AI!" to an audience filled with people who very much worry about climate change induced extinction and think that AI can't possibly be a real issue when Alexa can't even figure out which room's lightbulb it's supposed to switch on or off.</p>

<p>To put it in concrete terms: If your idea of "long term planning" means you are interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_lifting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">star-lifting</a> as way to extend the lifetime of the sun from a few billion years to a few tens of trillions, and you intend to help expand to fill the local supercluster with like-minded people, and your idea of "person" includes a mind running on a computer that's as power-efficient as a human brain and effectively immortal, then you're talking about giving 5*10^42 people a multi-trillion year lifespan.</p>

<p>If you're talking about giving 5*10^42 people a multi-trillion year lifespan, you will look like a massive arsehole if you say, for example, that "climate change killing 7 billion people in the next century is a small price to pay for making sure we have an aligned AI to help us with the next bit" — the observation that a non-aligned AI is likely to irreversibly destroy everything it's not explicitly trying to preserve isn't going to change anyone's mind, because even if you get past the <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Inferential_distance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inferential distance</a> that means most people hearing about this say "off switch!" (both as a solution to the AI and to whichever channel you're broadcasting on), at scales like this, utilitarianism <em>feels</em> wrong.</p>

<p>So, where does hyperbolic discounting come in?</p>

<p>We naturally discount the future as a "might not happen". This is good. No matter how certain we think we are on paper, there is always the risk of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excession#Outside_Context_Problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unknown-unknown</a>. This risk doesn't go away with more evidence, either — the classic illustration of the problem of induction is a turkey who observes that every morning they are fed by their farmer and so decides that the farmer has their best interests at heart; the longer this goes on for, the more certain they are of this, yet each day brings them closer to being slaughtered for thanksgiving. The currently-known equivalents in physics would be things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">false vacuums</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brane collisions triggering a new big bang</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain">Boltzmann brains</a> — but only from the point of view of people who have never heard of them before.</p>

<p>Because we don't know the future, we should discount it. There <em>are not</em> 5*10^42 people. There might <em>never</em> be 5*10^42 people. To the extent that there might be, they might turn out to all be Literally Worse Than Hitler. Sure, there's <em>a chance</em> of human flourishing on a scale that makes Heaven as described in the Bible seem worthless in comparison — and before you're tempted to point out that Biblical heaven is supposed to be eternal, which is infinitely longer than any number of trillions of years: that counter-argument presumes Utilitarian logic and therefore doesn't apply — but the further away those people and that outcome is from you, the less weight you should put on them really becoming and it really happening.</p>

<p>Instead: Concentrate on the here-and-now. Concentrate on ending poverty. Fight climate change. Save endangered species. Campaign for nuclear disarmament and peaceful dispute resolution. Not because there <em>can't</em> be 5*10^42 people in our future light cone, but because we can falter and fail at any and every step on the way from here.</p>
