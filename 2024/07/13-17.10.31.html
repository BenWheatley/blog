<div class="content"><h1>Food-based coding metaphors</h1>

<p><strong>Spaghetti code</strong> is a term of disparagement in software development, used to describe a code that's tangled and unstructured — much like a plate of spaghetti. This kind of code is difficult to follow, understand, and maintain.</p>

<p>This made me wonder what other food-based metaphors there might be for code.</p>

<p><strong>Lasagne code</strong> would naturally mean "layered and structured", the kind of thing to which we all aspire, where each part has a clear and well-defined form and location, and they are bound together in a predictable fashion.</p>

<p><strong>Fusilli code</strong>, which has all the problems of spaghetti code, except now each thread is shorter and it's up to you to figure out how they go together. This is how I have come to see "Clean Code":</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that.</p>
<footer>— Robert C. Martin</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, aim for less than 10 lines, and "as few arguments as possible, ideally none".</p>

<p>I am not a fan of this. I've seen code which genuinely had a thousand(!) lines inside an <code>if {}</code> block, and that was easier to read like that than if the <code>if</code> had been split up this way. Don't get me wrong, that thousand line <code>if {}</code> block was still really bad code, it's just that splitting it up this way would have made it worse, not better.</p>

<p><strong>Alphabetti-spaghetti code</strong> sounds like a good name for anything involving a RegEx.</p>

<p><strong>Mystery sausage code</strong> would be a good name for neural networks: a mixture of unknown origin whose contents are homogenised to the point of being indeterminable. You're never quite sure what goes into them, you're never sure if they're safe, and if you're not careful about your suppliers you might find you're being fed one even when you were expecting something of higher quality.</p>

<p><strong>Spicy code</strong> covers up an incredibly basic rote task with a fancy <code>import</code>ed extra, akin to how the difference between making Mexican and Indian cuisine can be as little as "which spice kit did I add to my mix of onion, tomato, and peppers, which I then serve with rice?"</p>

<p><strong>Traditional home-cooked organic code</strong> has to be FOSS in general. Proponents tell you how much better it is than the factory stuff, or how this gives you control over what you're consuming, but most people don't care and find this pretentious.</p>

<p><strong>Coca-coda</strong> — just as soda is almost entirely synthetic, not recommended by dietary experts, and yet still one of the most popular drinks on the planet, so too is AI-generated code almost entirely synthetic, disfavoured by experts, and extremely popular.</p>

<p><strong>Allotment code</strong> is where the consumer is also the creator, and they do it more for fun than anything else — personal projects, like everything on my own GitHub page.</p>

<p><strong>Fast code</strong> is the developer wasn't paid to care, just to shovel out as much as possible as fast as possible for as little money as possible. May involve <strong>Coca-coda</strong> and <strong>Spicy code</strong>.</p>
