<h1>Spendable votes</h1>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>Democracies come in many forms, but all have at least one of these problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your vote only really makes a difference when it's close â€” if you're in a constituency which always votes 70-80% for the Beige party, any vote will be wasted regardless of if you prefer Beige, Taupe, or Ecru.</li>
<li>Power is discrete: the winner retains full power until they are removed. Removal is either on a fixed schedule, or at the winner's preferred time, or a forced removal due to e.g. impeachment</li>
<li>Nuance is hard: any given voter cannot say "I like these two teams equally, and want them to share power, but absolutely never that other team"</li>
</ul>

<h2>The idea</h2>

<ol>
<li>At any given election, all voters are given some number of votes, and each is free to distribute their votes as desired amongst all the candidates.</li>
<li>Each standing politician has their votes totalled up, and added to a ledger.</li>
<li><em>All</em> standing politicians are then entitled to participate in parliament/congress/etc.</li>
<li>When legislation etc. is voted on, each politician may <em>spend</em> the votes they received. This spending is recorded on the ledger, and reduces the available for subsequent votes.</li>
<li>When some threshold for unspent votes is met, new elections are called.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've not developed this into a detailed proposal; every point on that list has multiple options for how it could be implemented, and the whole idea needs to be carefully analysed for Nash game failures.</p>

<ul>
<li>How many votes? Are write-in candidates allowed? What about "none of the above"?</li>
<li>Is this "vote income" a one-off at the election, or is this treated as "for the duration of this parliament, you will get this each month/quarter/year"?</li>
<li>Really all standing politicians, or just all the ones who have unspent votes on the ledger?</li>
<li>How many votes are they allowed to spend on any given thing? All of them, or a percentage? What's the meta-rule for whipped votes?</li>
<li>Are politicians allowed to transact votes with each other, and if so under what conditions?</li>
<li>When is a new election called? If it is "when only one party still has votes to spend", can this be gamed? Is it when a fixed percentage of all votes have been spent?</li>
<li>Are all unspent votes from the previous elections wiped from the record with each subsequent election, or do they roll over?</li>
</ul>
