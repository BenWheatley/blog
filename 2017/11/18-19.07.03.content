<h1>Musk City, Antarctica</h1>
<p>One of the criticisms of a Mars colony is that Antarctica is more hospitable in literally every regard (you might argue that the 6-month day and the 6-month night makes it less hospitable, to which I would reply that light bulbs exist and you'd need light bulbs all year round on Mars to avoid SAD-like symptoms).</p>

<p>I've just realised the 2017 BFR will be able to get you anywhere in Antarctica, from any launch site on Earth, in no more than 45 minutes, at the cost of long-distance economy passenger flights, and that the Mars plan involves making fuel and oxidiser out of atmospheric COâ‚‚ and frozen water ice so no infrastructure needs to be shipped conventionally before the first landing.</p>
