<h1>If I'm right about this, it's luck, not skill.</h1>
<p>Number #37 in the ongoing series of "questions that I can't even articulate correctly without a PhD, and if I Google it I'll just get a bunch of amateurs who've mistaken themselves for Einstein":</p>

<p>What if the apparent factor of 10¹²⁰ difference between the theoretical energy density of zero-point energy and the observed value of the cosmological constant is <em>because</em> that energy has gone into curving the 6-or-7 extra dimensions of string theory so tightly those extra dimensions can't be observed?</p>

<p>Testable (hah!) consequence: the Calabi–Yau manifolds of string theory would be larger (less tightly curved) inside Casimir cavities.</p>
