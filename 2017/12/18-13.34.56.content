<h1>I am not a quantum physicist</h1>
<p>I am not a quantum physicist. I do not write this prediction thinking that it is true or a novel deduction on the nature of reality. I write this prediction in order to test my own understanding of quantum physics.</p>

<p>Given all particles are fields:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Fermions are those fields where probability is in the range 0-1 (or possibly -1 to +1, depending on antimatter).</li>
	<li>Bosons are those fields where probability can take on any positive or zero value (possibly also any negative value, depending on antimatter).</li>
</ol>

<p>This "explains" why two fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state, yet bosons can. Inverted quote marks, because this might turn out to not have any explanatory power.</p>

<p>I'm fine with that, just as I'm fine with being wrong. I am not a quantum physicist. I don't expect to be right. It would be nicer to find I'm wrong rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong" target="_blank">not even wrong</a>, but even that's OK â€” that's why I'm writing this down before I see if someone else has already written about this.</p>
