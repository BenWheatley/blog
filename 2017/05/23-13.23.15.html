<div style="font-family:Sans-Serif;font-size:90%;">

<strong>AN:</strong> Prime Minister, you started this campaign with a huge double digit lead in the polls, it’s now down to single digits in some polls. What’s gone wrong?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> As I have done over the National Health Service at all of their house during their families when it won’t have set out in rules for example, we work to do they won’t have seen how we do in our system will see us to do on the European countries, me just explain, if we’ve got the party who are ones that he doesn’t really matter of people, this election yet.

<strong>AN:</strong> So why do you think your lead has narrowed?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> But this is separate from Europe, and that enables us and that’s always have to ensure that we said many times before, where this issue, we referred to fix it was a very real choice between two major issues we work on that we have to help them with the new rules for the funds to take those views of reducing taxes on which I always want to ensure that the National Health Service at how the 8th June when we should be two people who do they will collapse unless we have to do, as EU migration in ensuring we are deliberately trying to do that takes place on to work at our place on people want to show people face is so we need to pay for workers.

<strong>AN:</strong> But could you be in a little bit of trouble now, because you were so sure of winning that you thought you could get away with a lot of uncosted and half-baked policies?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> We are those views of 75.

<strong>AN:</strong> But your policies are uncosted and half-baked aren’t they?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> Well the tone for a party – our social care for everybody on the next Parliament.

<strong>AN:</strong> Well, let’s look at social care for the elderly. Four days ago your manifesto rejected a cap on social care costs, today you announced a cap. That sounds pretty half-baked.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> What we need to take this election campaign, as the best deal for the right thing about people won’t have the numbers of an election because what I want to day to have to pay for those views of these things, we have done today is an election on businesses and we can put in those here, politicians here in our manifesto the sand, or Jeremy Corbyn wants to get Brexit negotiations you’ve quoted, and talk to the immigration target is a crucial part of abuse that we haven’t got to get the United Kingdom who are ones that we’re going to take people’s views, the best deal is such a strong hand in which I believe that the UK who is – we will have to pay for a fall, but this is working families when it now.

<strong>AN:</strong> But you say nothing has changed. Jeremy Hunt, on the day you launched your manifesto, last Thursday, the Health Secretary, he said, ‘yes, we are dropping the cap and we’re being completely explicit in our manifesto, we’re dropping it. We don’t think it’s fair.’ Today you announced a cap.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> And I think it’s me – for people trust to pass £100,000 on where one poll that the European Union talking about ensuring that concept of money than they trust to see pressure on it was that politician – What I think it is being funded, that’s a strong hand in which set out in extra 8 billion that’s what I want to support me – under the things that in the table in which there will face as I set out a choice that we can fund our intention to fix it, and that’s going to bury my vision for people about all generations, and growth in the public services that we’re able to do something about the way that takes place in Europe and bring home the cost that we have had brought in a matter what was developed when people for people trust to responsibility.

<strong>AN:</strong> But it’s a cap, Prime Minister. Your manifesto rejects a cap. It gives a reason why you don’t want a cap. Now you’re going to have a cap. You need to be honest, I would suggest and tell the British people you’ve changed your mind.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> And absolutely honest that strong economy to be able to that, a strong economy to cap rip off energy price rises.

<strong>AN:</strong> So Jeremy Corbyn is now rewriting your manifesto?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> On winter fuel payments protected, but it’s important, why we’re re-elected, we will be able to frustrate and vulnerable people will ask people, this country will feel that tell us to do they trust to frustrate and that’s all the ways in the future, that’s all of employment market is – these are committed to generate by playing on the 10s of the strong and that’s what I have plans to have every year and others on the Conservative government since 2010 we’ve seen it go up to put in the key issue today is the strength in ensuring we do this, otherwise our policy means that other things that is being funded, that’s what level that in the Green Paper, of ways in the Prime Ministers, the next Parliament.

<strong>AN:</strong> Well, that’s what it sounds like. You’ve reacted to him.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> That’s about trust to get the Prime Minister until the changes that patient care policy, which I think was fair to do, as I thought it go into hospital, they trust to do and that’s where we have plans off energy bills and they can actually if they’re going to face is sitting there, you have that we have done on that you tick a very real terms of employment and I accept that takes place in the 8th they trust to that, crucial election – And under my team, that what Jeremy Corbyn and that’s what I want to ensure that we have the right to try to face up to do in our system will face up to deal for the European countries, me and the moment.

<strong>AN:</strong> To be honest, Prime Minister, to reject a cap in your manifesto and four days later say we’re going to have a cap, what’s honest about that?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> It’s either me and social care and others on their children have to have an aging society – No, I’m being able to go into Number 10 by playing politics with our European Union countries into the way money will have to take this issue, we must fix it does have the patient care policy which are a country and that’s in which address this genuinely is the system that we’re going beyond the reason I’ve done over the views of half the end all this issue, we want to do support those views on that we generate by playing politics with the European Union, have an aging population, we have to sneak into the 8th of that money you an election several weeks ago, I may, why we’re taking place on where this is that deficit down – for 31 million tax cut for the things – Being on the NHS, the Andrew Dilnot had brought in those views on the European partners.

<strong>AN:</strong> You’re just going to change your mind.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> That’s why who people who believe ordinary people to be changing the opportunity and pretend the care is a whole issue is – we will make some people not in terms increase the NHS, the worry about all the Green Paper, many times before, where that strength of money already announced that we generate by three-quarters.

<strong>AN:</strong> When Labour said you were against a cap they were right until today. You were against a cap.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> That’s what we haven’t got the employment market is in the things that they need to do something people as we’re going out in the strength of the table in the same time there are working families when it is better than they can say I think are a choice is who’s going to protect workers.

<strong>AN:</strong> But it’s a cap on lifetime social cost, which worries people as well. I mean, this must be the first time in modern history that a party’s actually broken a manifesto policy before the election.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> And Jeremy Corbyn wants to generate funds to ensure that we will go into place on A&amp;E who are the complete opposite of paying income tax altogether and Emergency targets and when we are other things that work to the National Health Service at how the sand, I’m not at what I’m saying we need to work on social care for the immigration target is are changing the challenges that money coming out my government since 2010 we’ve done today is that are some changes that we have done is ensure that there’s a series of charities, of what the dock when – and talk to take us to try to their votes, where they’ve made it come from the Brexit vote.

<strong>AN:</strong> Alright, now that you’re in favour of a cap, can you give us an idea of what the cap might be, the amount we’ll have to pay for social care?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> It’s really important that we’re ensuring people want to be able to punish us to ensure that we can only be protecting people to say the strong economy to see higher paid jobs in government, as EU migration in setting it was fair to ensure that we will face up at it won’t have seen the cost of the question that when I want to worry that you need a party who are continuing to get into the same time as we should be provided if we’ve removed those plans off pensioners will be following.

<strong>AN:</strong> Why did you not put the consultation on a cap in your manifesto? Instead your manifesto rejects a cap.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> We need to people want to do that it now.

<strong>AN:</strong> You’re not playing politics with this, Prime Minister?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> In fact it comes in, but we’ve removed those who is important for the right negotiating hand, with the economy to try and growth in lower tax cut for the next five years but crucially what I think it won’t have to fix it, and by playing politics with people may not on to people not just said, there are being honest that will see a Conservative government – for the next five years but actually is used, but it’s the proposals that we’re able to these two people are doing those views of the European Union talking to mind about this election campaign, as a bad deal with the strong economy that you need to ensure that underpins this genuinely is a bad deal with the party who is who’s going to the key issue of the parliament.

<strong>AN:</strong> You came out against a cap, you’re now in favour of a cap because of the backlash – that’s not playing politics?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> We need to try to protect people, and that’s the dock when we are deliberately trying to reduce immigration target and we have done, if we’ve seen in those Brexit deal with our public services that is getting the same time there have to take into the right deal with our system that counts in the immigration and protect workers.

<strong>AN:</strong> Alright, let me move on now, because many people have said your manifesto’s quite vague when it comes to how you’re going to pay for your spending pledges. So let’s see if we can get some clarity tonight. How are you going to pay for the extra £8 billion for the NHS?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> Andrew, what I’m going to take this crucial to say I go away, but crucially of ensuring we always want to reduce immigration – People do and I’ve identified in the weekend.

<strong>AN:</strong> But how do get the extra money for the NHS? Where will the extra 8 billion come from?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> I’m setting the complete opposite those people have said today is ensure that we’re building that was to work at the Andrew Neil Interview, but also the immigration and the European Commission? Who do on A&amp;E who is a choice on people face on the results of trust to reduce immigration was needed and the figures – And on the 8th June 8th June is – I talked about this is a strong economy that we have been before people as I have to be very clear that we bring in terms increase borrowing and I’ve clarified what does have set out in the manifesto is that you look at – some areas where we always been a sustainable way that level that strength in the manifesto was talking to show people trust to them about the strong economy that report that their NHS is a strong economy across all that actually takes place on social care for people have to have brought in ten years’ time as we’re doing is being employed and going to people here in the numbers of its targets, but also went on the British people to worry because it’s separate from a cap rip off the country has missed some of two million tax – there’s a choice that level that tell us to try to get the view of all, Andrew, the Naylor Report.

<strong>AN:</strong> Your ability to answer this question may be in doubt, Prime Minister. Let me try one more time. Where will the extra 8 billion for the NHS come from?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> No.

<strong>AN:</strong> But that’s not extra money, that’s moving the money around.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> What we’ve put into Downing Street last few years but let’s look at what I called this election – And the next five years but actually is to sell their care policy will feel that enables us getting the whole question that we want to their house during their lifetime.

<strong>AN:</strong> So it’s not an extra 8 billion?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> We have based our policy will be Prime Minister until the next term sustainability in the views of the dock on the immigration target is not going to fix it through this genuinely is one of an election yet.

<strong>AN:</strong> Well, the Labour Party have given us costings and given us revenues, you can’t give me. Let me ask another way, is it all new money?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> Yes, we have been, we’re making and promising to deliver what I think, the Labour Party that we’re fixing it go into the strong and indeed has changed from your head in government, as I want to get the economy in social care costs.

<strong>AN:</strong> Is the 8 billion all new money?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> I want to work to have the view of good school place on where you spend on buildings and what we’ll do something about putting in government, whoever’s Prime Minister for the National Health Service at what I mean immigration as we’re the NHS is ensured that the only poll that should be there will have to have asked Matthew Taylor to responsibility.

<strong>AN:</strong> The manifesto pledges, quote, ‘the most ambitious programme on investment and buildings and technology the NHS has ever seen’. Is that part of the 8 billion?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> We’ll get any of its targets, but yes and when we do is that people – When people for everybody on the things – Being on the principles on these issues around that we always been worried by changing the scaremongering, I’ve identified – Oh, it is not going to reduce taxes on the party that we’re re-elected, we can only poll that the Labour Party that’s a series of employment and working families when it now.

<strong>AN:</strong> So how much?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> Well, as EU migration as a lot of that people don’t have to reduce immigration and bring home the proposals in those people have to saying that are willing to make their care policy, which we face – and with our policy, here is playing politics with this, otherwise our intention to do that we bring home the studio in social care that we generate funds to address as I – it’s the weekend.

<strong>AN:</strong> And where will that come from?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> I will consult.

<strong>AN:</strong> That’s a point you’ve made, Prime Minister.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> But this country so important for their votes, where we will face on us to a fall, but you spend on the Presidents, the Labour Party is not realise a strong and talking to get the EU, but this election being funded, that’s a vision for Britain for the future and the European Union, have to make their care policy that I’ve just the line, it’s going to say that underpins this is our record, is the Prime Ministers, the key issue of sources, it’s beyond that, is ensuring people have their choice on that patient care policy means test winter fuel allowance but also believe ordinary people will be about debt and talk to a consultation, so that wants to do this, doesn’t want to negotiate a crucial election – And on the scaremongering, frankly, that choice on to responsibility.

<strong>AN:</strong> But let me come back to the NHS. Our hospitals have just endured their worst 12 months in ten years. A record number of urgent operations were cancelled, a string of targets, from emergency care to routine care, to cancer care, have been missed. What you’re promising is too little too late.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> That will be paying during their choice between a good school place in new rules for those plans off energy bills for me or Jeremy Corbyn wants to get a party who want to make some examples of policies which our policy, here who people don’t add up to people want to get a Conservative government since 2010 we’ve seen in the 8th June 8th they are other parties were very clear, here’s our manifesto is who is a series of course, Andrew Neil Interview, but you could show people over the National Health Service at how the way money is important for their bank accounts to do and that enables us and worrying about building that table in the British people about punishing the ability to sneak into health and my vision for people have the proposals that money is important that table in our manifesto some examples of people about getting Brexit negotiations but crucially is in ten years’ time there are other parties were taking those here, politicians here is proposing comes, because it’s the funds to the scaremongering, frankly, that you look at the way in rules for the dock when we need to work to put in all that report that we need to be following.

<strong>AN:</strong> You’ve ruled out a rise in VAT, but not National Insurance or income tax. Why?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> What we haven’t got down because what is proposing comes, because I want uncontrolled migration in government, what we put in new forms of people, and stable leadership I saw was taking place on the – and Lara Prendergast discuss Andrew Neil’s interview with the NHS, the Brexit negotiations right and with it – yes and crucially is important that we’re going to have to deal is getting the strength of course is a Conservative Party that’s what we’ve got the British people taken out in Opposition.

<strong>AN:</strong> So National Insurance and income tax could go up?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> And I’m very clear, here’s our record, is who want to try to any old deal which we generate the principles on June is the strong hand in negotiations right, getting those Brexit negotiations and growing economy that concept of money can actually ensure that we are continuing to deliver what I haven’t got down and what I want to protect people, this is sitting opposite of principles on their lifetime.

<strong>AN:</strong> But you haven’t ruled out rises in these two taxes.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> Beyond that, Andrew Dilnot had brought forward in the next Parliament.

<strong>AN:</strong> Except the tax burden is now the highest for 30 years under your government.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> No.

<strong>AN:</strong> The highest.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> It’s £10 billion that’s a social care is I’ve done over the manifesto was right and my lifetime, because we have had over the reason I’ve seen it now.

<strong>AN:</strong> You tried to raise National Insurance for the self employed in the Budget a couple of months ago, you were forced to retreat. Can you rule out that you’ll try that again?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> No, what I have a struggle when – what I mean immigration target is better than a Conservative Party have done on the proposals in government, whoever’s Prime Ministers, the strong economy with the NHS is separate from them, and my party of the future and we are changing in doubt.

<strong>AN:</strong> So National Insurance could go up?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> On the National Health Service at – and when I want to be putting those from the future and targets and when the dock on buildings and that’s what is a plan for a series of June 8th June when people here on the future is that we are continuing to decide, ‘cause it’s me – and we referred to take us that as I’ve heard the world.

<strong>AN:</strong> But you could bring them back.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> Or we need to be Prime Ministers, the new rules for a year and the UK who is to who’s in the National Health Service at our economy, it’s important, why we’ve got in – we should be a tax payers.

<strong>AN:</strong> I understand. That’s a point you’ve made several times. I want to come on to the Just About Managing. People who are just about managing. They’re not the poorest of the poor but they’re not that affluent either. Life can be a bit of a struggle. You say you’re on their side but inflation is now rising faster than average pay so living standards are being squeezed and you’ve frozen their in-work benefits for almost 7 million people. In what way are you on their side?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> No.

<strong>AN:</strong> But they’re squeezed an income at the moment. In what way are you on their side? You’ve taken away £280 a year from their in work benefits because of the freeze. How is that being on their side?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> It’s between two ways that people won’t have seen how we must fix them about it comes first and when – as you say the Naylor Report, which we are people want to sit around the end of paying income tax payers.

<strong>AN:</strong> Not taking money away.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> What I’ve seen it again because I and that we do want to make sure that we’ve already into Accident and social care for example, we can actually cast their lifetime.

<strong>AN:</strong> They would like better pay. They’d like their living standards to be rising. You’re squeezing them.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> But there’s a GP, and others indeed, the National Health Service, but you’re right, getting the way people as I’ve put in the money that the deal for the worry, day to that, a choice on the right and that believes in Opposition.

<strong>AN:</strong> How many pensioners will lose their winter fuel allowance?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> You can put record sums of the European Union countries into the dock when I think this is what we have to worry about building a strong and talking to do is important that we can only be putting a system that level that we’re seeing hospitals relieved from the strong economy to protect more money will be all of thousands.

<strong>AN:</strong> So you don’t know. Pensioners watching tonight, they won’t know. The very rich they’re going lose, that’s clear. The very poor will probably keep it, but the vast in between you cannot tell them tonight whether they’ll get up to £300 or not this coming winter.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> Andrew, when we take people’s views, the economy, we put your long experience, and others on the future – Well I’m not that whoever is going out my vision for those in new rules for granted about it does have not in the Labour Party that’s why I’m not at the great challenges that we have uncontrolled migration in doubt.

<strong>AN:</strong> But you can’t tell them tonight or not whether they’re going to get their winter fuel allowance or not. It’s a vague promise, uncosted, you don’t know.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> No.

<strong>AN:</strong> But asking you where, how will you do it?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> You can ignore it, which money you should have was developed when we will see higher paid jobs in the same time as we’re able to pay for the – we’re doing, is what we want to fix it now.

<strong>AN:</strong> Wouldn’t you have done that before you came out with the policy?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> And that’s what does that people here on how the NHS is the 8th of June, then I called an aging society – No, I’m very clear that we’re going to go into Number 10 by some of course, Andrew – and organisations at our manifesto is going to bury my party that we want to sell their social care and that’s why we’re supporting is being able to responsibility.

<strong>AN:</strong> You’ve promised twice to reduce immigration to the 10s of thousands and twice you failed. Why should we believe you a third time?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> But in the question for a very clear that he doesn’t really develop the worry if you spend on, as I want to look at the key issue of the – what we’re going to say the proposals for Britain we’ve got an absolute limit on the – and we’re doing, what matters is ensuring we have a tax – what I’ve seen how long that report when people about putting a good deal with this, otherwise our system that we have to take people’s views, the new forms of that we wanted to ensure that I want to people over the line, it’s right thing to be about building that we generate by ensuring we have done, Andrew, I think it will have to do, as I want to fund social care costs.

<strong>AN:</strong> But you’ve always had that power. You’ve always had that power with non-EU migration and you’ve never managed to get that down to the 10s of thousands. Even the bit you’ve controlled you haven’t managed to control.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> You know, so that was right deal with them about ensuring that provides sustainability in the patient care policy will go into Accident and vulnerable people are saying that we’re backing the right and the Brexit negotiations you’ve quoted, and by playing on the UK? No.

<strong>AN:</strong> It’s still away above 10s of thousands.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> So we’ve already into those from the scaremongering, frankly, that counts in lower tax – our social care for the Brexit negotiations and we bring in lower tax, has missed some people about all generations, and we have a consultation that is so much depends on to start fixing it does that money is sometimes find life a leader who are we could show people want to who’s sitting there, you know, so we will collapse unless we need to fix them with the worry, day to who’s going to do they die.

<strong>AN:</strong> But you’re not bringing it down.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> Beyond that, is that wants to be very clear that we’re seeing hospitals relieved from them, and talk to be a Conservative Party has believed in my vision for the principles on it was talking about ensuring people here in the cost that we will look at it in my lifetime, it’s going to play politics with the British people about a matter of charities, the European Commission? Who do they die.

<strong>AN:</strong> Net migration is higher now than it was when you came to power in 2010.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> We have the figures did see higher paid jobs in our social care policy means test winter fuel payments protected, but you’re right, and we wanted to do these two major issues they will be there and a consultation, so that actually talking to the Labour Party that provides sustainability in which are working to protect workers.

<strong>AN:</strong> Still high.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> Sharp contrast with people here who were taking those from the future of Brexit negotiations right, getting Brexit negotiations right thing to do in the system, but this is one figure: in certain areas where we will ask people, charities, organisations and we have actually talking about the dock when they will not rewritten the National Health Service at it comes to be putting those Brexit negotiations you’ve got in which there will means test winter fuel payments protected, but also answered that we’re doing that of course the future of trust, because they need to be is not on the right in the principles on us controlling migration as well off pensioners for the future – Well I’m doing, what people want? Now, in which I go up to do something about this whole country will do on us to ensure that the age of good school places.

<strong>AN:</strong> Doesn’t this go to the heart, Prime Minister, of why people have lost trust in politicians? You make promises, you fail to keep them, but you just make the same promise again.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> And let me and we do that of trust to know from the Budget, we’ve done is in certain areas where we are doing the principles on to be putting a bad deal is a very – it’s about having both a good school places.

<strong>AN:</strong> The Conservatives promise to end the budget deficit by 2015 is now going to be 2025 at the earliest. You promised to reduce migration to the 10s of thousands. It’s still 273,000. On these two big issues you failed to meet your promises, why would we trust the Tories on anything else?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> They’ll be two million tax cut for everybody on this issue, we referred to ensure that enables us to make their lifetime.

<strong>AN:</strong> But these are big issues, Prime Minister. The budget deficit, how we spend and borrow and tax. The immigration which was a huge issue as you will know on the Brexit campaign and so on, on these two major issues you have failed to keep your promises.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> We’ve seen over the number of our manifesto some people have been fake claims about our manifesto the last year and when I want to deal for the way people who sometimes find life a protected £100,000 on that the proposals for the one of sources, it’s about ensuring that I’ve identified in which means test that underpinned that we will not going to frustrate those negotiations right, and pay for the dock on which means test winter fuel allowance but it’s going to have the crucial choice between parties, there’s a system will be provided if we’re fixing it now.

<strong>AN:</strong> Indeed.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> Well if you spend on the Labour Party in which we have plans to be protecting people don’t need to ensure that the UK? No.

<strong>AN:</strong> George Osborne says not a single senior member of your Cabinet supports the immigration target. Is that true?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> You mentioned the system will have, if I want to put in the patient gets the European partners.

<strong>AN:</strong> He said nobody supports in your Cabinet.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> We will go into our economic credibility is what they’re sitting around the opportunity and we believe that choice, which I say, the sand, I’m not have every confidence is what we have been, we’re supporting is the way money coming out in relation to people, of course, Andrew Neil Interview, but it’s the need strength of June 8th of living, our future of this election yet.

<strong>AN:</strong> You said last week that Britain faces, I quote: “dire consequences” if we fail to get a good deal in the Brexit talks for leaving the EU. What sort of “dire consequences?”

<strong>MayBot:</strong> And I want to try to do they trust to deliver what we’re the manifesto is not realise a modern industrial strategy to get the 8 billion black hole in the way money coming from inside the manifesto we’ve removed those here, politicians here is a good school places.

<strong>AN:</strong> What were the “dire consequences.” If we don’t get a deal what will the “dire consequences” be?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> And what we’re able to worry that money into the NHS is you look at the 8 billion that we have done over the great challenges that enables us to all the Green Paper, of an absolute limit on the last year and a draft industrial strategy to do for granted about what I’m going into Number 10 by three-quarters.

<strong>AN:</strong> So it’s not dire?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> We will be consistently working at it go into the be talking about those here, politicians here who believe in the 10s of employment market is – and that’s what you say the line, it’s beyond that, crucial to ensure that we haven’t got some of half the problem and we bring that are being able to do these things, we haven’t got some changes that patient gets the whole issue of principles on the things that strong economy with the country has changed from them, and vulnerable people coming from the Labour Party who’s in the complete opposite of that I have to people who believe it will look at our future and we haven’t got through this issue of the changes that we are changing in any old deal with it now.

<strong>AN:</strong> But you haven’t told us what – I don’t understand why no deal can be better than a bad deal, but no deal would also mean “dire consequences” and you haven’t told us what the consequences would be.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> What we – of the issues around the strong economy with it, and that’s what was taking those Brexit vote.

<strong>AN:</strong> I understand that, but you’re now saying that no deal – you’re now saying no deal means “dire consequences” and I’m trying to find out how dire the consequences will be.

<strong>MayBot:</strong> Now, our policy means that we want to fix it now.

<strong>AN:</strong> And if you win on June 8th, Prime Minister – if you win, how long will you stay Prime Minister?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> I thought it needs, as I saw was taking place on which is the opportunity and having a fall, but we have uncontrolled migration down because it’s beyond the country, because a system will be able to decide, ‘cause it’s going to be one of mandate behind us forward previous proposals in certain areas where you have done, if you need to work and vulnerable people, charities, of all, Andrew, there’s only be set out in the deficit down and having both a sustainable way A&amp;E who do for that we’re about the right to the Labour want to negotiate a good school places.

<strong>AN:</strong> And how long will you stay?

<strong>MayBot:</strong> What I’ve done on fears, by some people want to pass £100,000 on that counts is so important for the issues that we will do in my party, me just the NHS is going to do want to ensure we always have plans off energy price rises.

<strong>AM:</strong> You’ll stay for the next Parliament?
