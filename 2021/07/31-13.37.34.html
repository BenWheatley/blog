<div class="content"><h1>How big might real wormholes be?</h1>
<p>AFAICT, there is no actual evidence for real wormholes existing, they are merely interesting ideas not obviously forbidden by known physics.</p>

<p>That said, they are fun to think about. Quoth Wikipedia: "The quantum foam hypothesis is sometimes used to suggest that tiny wormholes might appear and disappear spontaneously at the Planck scale and stable versions of such wormholes have been suggested as dark matter candidates.", so I just decided to see how big such a wormhole might become if it popped into existence right before the Big Bang inflationary period began and lasted at least until the end.</p>

<p>Inflation itself lasted for an unknown time, but a minimum bound is that it expanded the universe by a factor of e^60 (≅ <s>10^60</s> 10^26), which means 1 Plank length would expand to… 1.8458 nanometers. Tiny though that is, it would still be very useful for communications. I wonder how many of those you'd need to have in the universe for their existence to even be testable with current tech?</p>
