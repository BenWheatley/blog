</p>

</p>

<p>

<p>Even stage magic isn't magic, it's just a lot of practice, sleight of hand, etc. — as the stage magicians Penn and Teller (well, just Penn) said, stage magic is about making something very hard look easy, so much so that your audience simply doesn't even imagine the real effort you put into it.</p>

<p>So sure, AI isn't magic in the "supernatural" sense, but as Clarke said <q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic</a></q>, which is how we have come to have what are essentially synthetic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_deity">Húsvættir</a> in the form of Alexa and Siri, where us knowing their (if you will excuse the occult reference) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_name">true names</a> allows us to bind them to our will — which, thanks to the mundanity of reality, is mostly just turning lights on and off for us, or adding things to shopping lists…</p>
